Overview :
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major global health concern, projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death by 2030. This project provides a digital health solution for early detection by analyzing lung sound recordings. The system integrates deep learning for diagnosis with a web-based platform for patient-doctor interaction.

Key Features:
AI Diagnosis: Users can upload breathing sound files for automated COPD risk prediction.
Deep Learning Engine: Utilizes CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to process audio patterns.
AI Chatbot: An integrated assistant to answer user queries regarding symptoms, prevention, and general COPD information.
Doctor Appointment System: A location-based search allows users to find and schedule appointments with nearby medical professionals.
Dual-Module Architecture: Features a dedicated Admin Module for data management and a User Module for personal health tracking.

Tech Stack:
Backend: Python (Django Framework)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Database: SQLite3
Machine Learning: CNN, LSTM (Deep Learning
